A complete redesign of UVTech Multiservices' website — from Figma prototype to production-ready React application.

---

## Project Overview

During my internship at **UVTech Multiservices**, I was tasked with redesigning the company website to demonstrate my design and frontend development skills. Rather than just delivering mockups, I decided to take it further and **build the entire website from scratch**.

This project showcases UI/UX design skills through Figma prototyping, frontend development using modern React patterns, responsive design with Tailwind CSS, and real-world problem solving for a business client.

---

## Tech Stack

- **React.js** — Component-based UI library
- **Vite** — Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first CSS framework
- **Figma** — Design and prototyping
- **Git & GitHub** — Version control

---

## Design Process

### Phase 1: Research & Planning
- Analyzed the existing website and identified pain points
- Researched competitor websites and industry trends
- Defined user flows and key pages

### Phase 2: Figma Prototyping
- Created wireframes for all major pages
- Designed high-fidelity mockups with brand colors
- Built interactive prototype to test user flows

### Phase 3: Development (Current)
- Setting up React + Vite + Tailwind environment
- Building reusable component architecture
- Implementing responsive layouts
- Adding interactivity and animations

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Rishukhati/uvtech-redesign.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd uvtech-redesign

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Design Preview

**Note:** The prototype includes placeholder content and is not the final version. It demonstrates the structure, layout, and interactions being built.

Screenshots and Figma link coming soon.

## Learning Objectives

This project is helping me develop skills in:

- **Component Architecture** — Breaking UI into reusable, maintainable pieces
- **State Management** — Managing data flow in React applications
- **Responsive Design** — Mobile-first approach using Tailwind utilities
- **Design Systems** — Creating consistent UI patterns and components
- **Client Communication** — Understanding and implementing business requirements
- **Version Control** — Professional Git workflow and collaboration practices

---

## Development Roadmap

**Completed:**
- Initial project setup
- Figma design completion

**In Progress:**
- Header and navigation component
- Hero section implementation
- Component architecture planning

**Upcoming:**
- Services section
- About section
- Contact form with validation
- Footer component
- Responsive optimization
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment

---

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Early Development

This is a work in progress. Code is being pushed incrementally as features are developed and tested. The final deliverable will be a fully functional, production-ready website for UVTech Multiservices.

## About This Project

This redesign is part of my internship at **UVTech Multiservices**. The project demonstrates my ability to take initiative beyond assigned tasks, balance design thinking with technical execution, deliver professional work for actual clients, and learn and adapt to new technologies.

**Why I took this approach:**
- Designing in Figma first helped me think through the user flow before writing any code
- Building it in React provides hands-on experience with component architecture and state management
- Using Tailwind CSS speeds up styling while maintaining consistency across the application
